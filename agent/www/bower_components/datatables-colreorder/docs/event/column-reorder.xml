			DataTables settings object for the table that has been modified
		</parameter>
		<parameter type="object" name="details">
			An object that contains information about the reordered columns:

			* `-type integer` `from` - Column index that the column has been moved from
			* `-type integer` `to` - Column index that the column has been moved to
			* `-type array` `mapping` - Array of integers that define how the old column positions map to the new positions
			* `-type boolean` `drop` - Indicate if this event is the result of a mouse drop (i.e. the user has finished moving the columns). This is useful to distinguish between a live reorder and the final state. Requires **ColReorder 1.2.1** or newer.

	<description>
		When using ColReorder you may wish to know when a table has been reordered by an end user or through the API. This event provides that information.

		This event is triggered when a column is reordered - if `cr-init colReorder.realtime` is enabled this can be during the column reordering drag.

		Please note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, or use the `dt-api on()` method to listen for the event which will automatically append this namespace.

	<example title="Add a class to the reordered column"><![CDATA[

var table = $('#example').DataTable( {
	colReorder: true
} );

table.on( 'column-reorder', function ( e, settings, details ) {
	var headerCell = $( table.column( details.to ).header() );

	headerCell.addClass( 'reordered' );

	setTimeout( function () {
		headerCell.removeClass( 'reordered' );
	}, 2000 );
} );
