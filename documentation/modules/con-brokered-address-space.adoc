= Brokered address space

The brokered address space is designed to support broker-specific features, at the cost of limited
scale in terms of the number of connections and addresses. This address space supports JMS
transactions, message groups, and selectors on queues and topics.

Clients can connect and send and receive messages in this address space using the AMQP, CORE, OpenWire, and MQTT protocols.
